# testing-difficulty-assesment-sv-comp

This repository contains 142 selected programs from 4 direcrories exists in sv-comp benchmarks.

The 4 repositories are:
jayhorn-recursive(23), jpf-regression (77), jbmc-regression (21), algorithms (21)

The programs are modified from the original sv-comp benchmarks to support intended analysis and and collecting ground truth by running a generator based random fuzzer. Modification of the program does not change original program semantics for testing difficulty assesment purpose.
